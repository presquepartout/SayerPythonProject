# I/O

Stands for input/output. In this lesson we will cover some fundamentals about feeding data into and extracting data out of python programs.

The work of the lesson will take place in a jupyter notebook, so let's review how to get notebooks up and running. 
In the previous lesson you installed virtualenv, created a virtual environment, installed jupyter, and started notebooks. 
Here is a review of how. 

## How to Activate Your Virtual Environment

Open a terminal window. Navigate to your `code` directory. 

If you remember the name of the virtual environment you created, say `my_env` - here is how you activate it: 

`source my_env/bin/activate`

Your unix prompt should now begin with `(venv)` indicating that you are inside the virtual environment `venv`. 

If you do not remember the name of your virtual environment, here is how to find out. You can use the Spotlight search 
to find a directory called `envs`. Click on it, and look at what is inside. For each virtual environment you have on your machine,
there should be a directory with the name of that environment. 

Find the one you created in Lesson Three. And activate it as above. 

## How to Obtain the Lesson Four Companion Notebook

- git pull
- download

Within your virtual environment, navigate to your copy of the `SayerPythonProject` directory.
