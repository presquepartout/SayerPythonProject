# Why and What

I have dabbled in programming for years. A few years ago I needed to learn programming in earnest.
The reason: to do applied math in a professional setting. 

First I concentrated on R. But then as I wanted to work with databases, and gather data from web APIs, I learned Python. 
Along the way, for machine learning purposes, I've used some Java, C, and Scala. 

Really learning this material takes time and effort. What I found missing from many introductory classes and tutorials was practicality.

Many venerated texts and university style classes are taught from a conceptual framework, which is great. 
But computer programming is completely grounded in application. It is necessary to do, to learn. And if one cannot do, one is stuck. 

The goal of these lessons in Python is to reach basic confidence in using a computer language, kind of the way a baby learns a language: 
It's not important for a baby to know the parts of speech or that sentences need subjects and predicates. 

It's very important for a baby to make eye contact and say hello, learn names of family members, ask for what she needs. 

So this is a course in learning to program like a baby learns to talk. To keep things simple, we restrict to one tool, the Mac, and a couple of environments: the command line and jupyter notebooks. 

We emphasize exploration over explanation. You are given things to try, and some of those things won't work. 
We will bump up against the rules. 

The hope is that with this series of experiences, you can move on to using computer programming as you wish.
It could be for fun. For making a few specific projects. As the basis of an education. As the basis of a career.
