# Goals for the First Ten Lessons

Be able to: 
- do basic math in Python
- write and save programs on the command line
- import modules and use them
- use iPython or Jupyter notebooks
- understand and use basic computer language constructs: types, conditionals, control structures
- use a few basic data structures
- use a few basic algorithms
- write modular code: functions
- understand and use basic object oriented programming: classes
- do easy challenges in leetcode.com, hackerrank.com, or other coding web sites
- follow a tutorial for a framework such as Flask
